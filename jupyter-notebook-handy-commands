# To auto populate the conda env list in the jupyter notebook install the below package in each conda environment
# conda install nb_conda
conda install -c anaconda nb_conda


# This will create a file named “jupyter_notebook_config.py” in your user folder.
# Open this file and search for “#c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = ‘‘
# Do not forget to remove the # symbol to uncomment and insert the path to your notebooks folder,
# using forward slashes, e.g. /home/dixitm/jupyter-workspace
